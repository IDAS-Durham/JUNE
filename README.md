# COVID Modelling

Repository for data and models built

Given the size of this team we should work in branches and merge regularly and separate folders for projects.

**Important Git LFS**
To be able to store data in the repo, and to avoid the problems related to it with git, the repo is configured to use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). Please install it. Every file with a ``.csv`` extension is then automatically dealt with Git LFS.
