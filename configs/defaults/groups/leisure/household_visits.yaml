# 17 % of the old people have less than weekly contact
# 11 % less than monthly
# we assume that each person with a relative in a households has
# a 7% probability of visiting a relative there.
# This gives a weekly probability of 38% and 89% monthly
# assuming 3 hours of leisure a day, we have
# 1 - exp(-lambda * 3 hours * 7 days a week) = 0.38
# -> lambda = 1/21 * - log(1-0.38) = 0.0227 / hour -> 0.54 / day
