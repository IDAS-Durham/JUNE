## Visualizer

The JUNE visualiser can be run once a simualtion has finished and gives: summary statistics, infection information by geographical breakdown, hospital and admission specific information by geography.

### Running

**Note** Throughout these scripts we assume that the logger is saved as `[PATH TO RESULTS DIRECTORY]/logger.hdf5`.

Once a logger has been generated by the simualtion, this must be preprocessed:

```
python preprocess_data.py [PATH TO RESULTS DIRECTORY]
```

This will extract the data from the logger and save it in a `.csv` file.

Then the visualizer can be run:

```
python app.py [PATH TO RESULTS DIRECTORY]
```
