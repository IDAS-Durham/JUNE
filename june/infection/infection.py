        The epidemiology input uses a CollectionPriorModel of PyAutoFit, which has associated with it a Symptoms

        new infection is created new parameters its new Symptoms and Transmission instances are randomly from a
        distribution.

        For example the recovery_rate of the SymptomsConstant class have a uniform distribution with lower and upper
        limits of 0.2 and 0.4. When the infection takes place, a value between 0.2 and 0.4 is randomly drawn and
