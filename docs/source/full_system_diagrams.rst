Full-system diagrams
--------------------

.. warning::
   The full-system diagrams are very large and elaborate, so they are
   probably not as useful as the component diagrams. However, they are
   included for a full picture and they are readable when zoomed in,
   either in the browser or when downloaded and viewed in an image
   viewer/editor.
